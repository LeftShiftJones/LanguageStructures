**TASKR**

# Project

## Domain
We have decided to write a Domain-Specific Language to help with scheduling called Taskr. The domain for this problem is translating from written, "Bullet-Journal" style entries to an online calendar which will visualize these entries. The idea is that someone could use their smartphone to take a picture of their journal containing the proper formatted text and use computer vision and text recognition to translate this text into an HTML document.

## Purpose
The purpose of this language is to <!--get a good grade in this class -->handle the intermediary step of translating a text file into meaningful symbols that an HTML file can display to represent a personal calendar.

## Example
Here is an example of text that would be translated to html:
<hr>
```noformat
t(tomorrow): Do laundry; 2 feb 2019 [w 2 apr 2019]
    t: Sort laundry
        n: Whites go in blue basket
e: Sisters Birthday; 4 feb 2019
n: Received a compliment from David today!
```
<hr>

This will translate to:

<hr>
```html
<div class="container day">
  <h3>February 2nd, 2018</h3>
  <strong>TASK LIST:</strong>
  <div class="container">
      &amp;gt; Do laundry (repeats weekly)
    <div class="container">
      &amp;bull; Sort laundry
      <div class="container">
        &amp;mdash; whites go in the blue basket
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="container day d-none">
<!-- no tasks for February 3rd, 2018 -->
</div>

<div class="container day">
  <h3>February 4th, 2018</h3>
  <strong>TASK LIST:</strong>
  <div class="container">
    &amp;#9702; Sister's Birthday
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    &amp;mdash; Received a compliment from David today!
  </div>
</div>
```
<hr>

## Functionality

The HTML outputted by our grammar has a few unique characteristics. First of all, each 'status' of a task (done, later, tomorrow) has an associated symbol (&#88; &lt; &gt; respectively). Additionally, each type of 'entry' (task, event, note) has an associated symbol (&bull; &#9702; &ndash; respectively).

We will be using Bootstrap to format our HTML, which conveniently offers us an easy to indent different elements via the `<div class="container"></div>`. By nesting these, we can display sub-entries, and by putting these on the same hierarchy, we can visualize entries in parallel.

Our translator will have to do more than merely translation, however. Tasks and events are allowed to have repetitions associated with them, and thus the translator will need to generate the correct HTML output for a repeating event. Obviously, we cannot write an infinite file with every repetition onto eternity, so we will only generate HTML for a particular selected day (or month or year). The translator will need to decide which dates fall outside of the range that has been requested by the user, and only generate HTML for dates that are within the date constraints.

Finally, as a user appends new items to the `.taskr` file, we allow them to insert single-line comments, which the parser ignores. These comments could be very useful, for example, if a user is using a phone to generate their `.taskr` file, they could see when each entry was uploaded:

```noformat
// Uploaded on FEB 1, 2019
t(tomorrow): Do laundry; 2 feb 2019 [w 2 apr 2019]
   t: Sort laundry
       n: Whites go in blue basket
e: Sisters Birthday; 4 feb 2019

// Uploaded on FEB 5, 2019
n: Received a compliment from David today!
```

# Grammar

Our grammar is based around three key symbols:

The token `t` indicates a task. Tasks can have a `modifier` which indicates whether a task has been moved to a later date, the next day, or if it is completed. Tasks then have a `description` element describing what the task is. If a task has a semicolon followed by a `date` (in the format `dd mmm yyyy`), that task will be applied to that specific date. Date strings can have optional repeats for daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or every $n$ days, until another specified date. If no date is given, the task will be added to a global to-do list, unless it is tab-indented after another task element, in which case it will be seen as a subtask of a parent task (like a step in a process). The full range of parameters for tasks looks like this; optional paramters are indicated by `{item}`:

`t {(done|tomorrow|later)}: Task Description{; 1 Jan 2019 [(d|w|m|y|n 2) 1 Jan 2020]}`

The token `e` indicates an event. Events can have a `modifier` which indicates whether an event has been moved to a later date, the next day, or if it is completed. Events then have a `description` element describing what the event is. If a event has a semicolon followed by a `date` (in the format `dd mmm yyyy`), that event will be applied to that specific date. Like tasks, events can have repeating meeting periods, which can repeat until a certain date (this is built into the `date` grammar). Events do not have child events, like tasks have subtasks. The full range of parameters for events looks like this:

`e {(done|tomorrow|later)}: Event Description{; 1 Jan 2019 [(d|w|m|y|n 2) 1 Jan 2020]}`

The token `n` indicates that the text following is a note, which can be attached to a particular task or event (depending on tablulation, will be worked out in the parsing phase). Notes can have any number of characters followed by a newline character

# Parser

Our parser was auto-generated by ANTLR. We configured a `.java` file to test the parser on a testing document. The code follows:

```java
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        FileInputStream inputstream = new FileInputStream("inputs/test_doc.txt");
        ANTLRInputStream input = new ANTLRInputStream(inputstream);
        TaskrGrammarLexer lexer = new TaskrGrammarLexer(input);
        CommonTokenStream tokens = new CommonTokenStream(lexer);
        TaskrGrammarParser parser = new TaskrGrammarParser(tokens);
        parser.prog(); // parse the input stream!
    }
```

Our parser runs without any errors, making this a successful launch Houston.

# Translator

Our parser uses Java classes and helper functions to generate sample HTML output in our `tasks.html` file. It does this by using the current date as a reference point to display tasks, events, and notes that will occur over the next 7 days (not calendar week). We did this to make the program easy to run and reference for our custom classes. A future, more fully-featured implementation of this might include a date picker on the website for users to display the next seven days of items from that date. This would be fairly simple to do once we found a way to port this new date into our Java program, but we did not have time to do that during this project.


Here is the code from our Java Interface, off of which we built classes for Notes, Tasks, and Elements: 

```java
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.List;

public interface TaskrElement {
    String getDescription();
    String getModifier();
    String getRepeatModifier();
    Date getDate();
    Date getRepeatEndDate();
    Note getNote();

    String translate();

    List<TaskrElement> getChildren();

    void setDescription(String desc);
    void setModifier(String mod);
    void setRepeatModifier(String mod);
    void setDate(Date date);
    void setRepeatEndDate(Date date);
    void setNote(Note note);
    void addTaskrChild(TaskrElement el);
}
```

Below are screenshots of the web server running the generated HTML code:

![An image of our webpage with no listed events](./empty-page.png)

![An image of our webpage with tasks, events, and notes](./full-page.png)

Currently, few bugs exist for the program. As noted above, users cannot specify start dates for the 7-day period, it will always reference the current date. There are some strange formatting errors with descriptions:
- Forward slashes will remove the next character it sees
- Apostrophes will render a larger-than-normal space on either side of the symbol

This has been a very enjoyable project to work on. Although at first the prospect of building a custom language from scratch was daunting, we are pleased with what we produced during this semester.


# Operation

To operate the application, the user must have several things:

- Current version of ANTLr
- At least Java version 8
- Python version 3.7 or later

In order to get the web server working, python must have a working virtual environment and flask installed. To do this, run the commands:

[`$ python3 -m venv venv`] &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <-- Sets up virtual environment

[`$ python3 -m pip install flask`] &nbsp; &nbsp; <-- Installs flask

Then, to start the server, do: [`$ python3 launch.py`] in the root directory of the project. The displayed info will give a link where the user will be able to view their schedule as generated by the Taskr visitor.

To add Tasks, Events, and Notes to the schedule, simply modify the file called `test_doc.txt` in the `./taskr/inputs` folder of the project. Adding items follows the conventions seen above in the [Functionality](./readme.md.html#toc1.4) and Grammar sections of this document.

Finally, run `./taskr/src/Tasker.java` (we used an IDE to help with the ANTLr plugin stuff). This will read the data in the inputs file, and then translate it to HTML. Refreshing the browser (with the python service running) will produce a task list for the next 7 days.
